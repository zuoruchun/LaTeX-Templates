Time-changed stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are widely used in financial market modeling as an important tool to describe sub-diffusion phenomena. Therefore, research on numerical methods of time-changed stochastic differential equations has attracted much attention. Traditional solution methods mainly include classic explicit methods such as Euler-Maruyama method and Milstein method. Time-changed stochastic differential equations which coefficients satisfy global Lipschitz are usually numerically approximated by classical explicit methods that are simple, easy to implement, and highly computationally efficient. However stochastic differential equations with superlinear growth terms, the classic explicit methods tend to diverge.

This paper proposes a truncated Milstein method for a class of highly nonlinear non-autonomous stochastic differential equations with time-changed processes, using the idea of truncation to suppress superlinear growth terms. This method retains the advantages of the explicit method. The article proves strong convergence in a finite time interval properties, and obtained the convergence order. 

In a class of time-changed stochastic differential equations studied in this article, the spatial variables in the drift and diffusion coefficients satisfy the superlinear growth condition, and the temporal variables satisfies the H{\"o}lder continuity condition. In addition, the duality principle does not apply to these types of time-changed stochastic differential equations, so the connection between the classical stochastic differential equations and the time-changed stochastic differential equations cannot be established, so we can only directly construct a numerical method for the time-changed stochastic differential equations. In this paper, by constructing the truncated Milstein method,
and it is proven that the convergence order of this numerical method is ${\min\{\gamma_f,\gamma_g,(1-2\varepsilon)\}}$, where $\gamma_f$ and $\gamma_g$ represents the H{\"o}lder exponents of the temporal variables and $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small number. This conclusion implies that the convergence order of the truncated Milstein method is related to the smoothness of the temporal variables. When the smoothness is poor, the convergence order of the numerical method is determined by the H{\"o}lder exponents of the temporal variables. When the smoothness is good, the convergence order of this method approaches 1. At the end of the paper, the theoretical results of numerical examples of one-dimensional and two-dimensional time-changed stochastic differential equations through Matlab were verified.
